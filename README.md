# PHP-code-sample-3

This code samples is from one of projects which was related to a Home Loan survey. My job was to make a survey using custom javascript without using js libraries and manage the backend work with plain PHP. 

I have also created a theme swticher which change the color scheme of the project using a handle on the frotend and remembers the color scheme.
